# Tanker Water Script

Tanker water release script for the Free Mode Designs LTD Tanker

# How to use

- Ensure the spawncode in the config.lua is the same as the vehicle spawn code
- When sat in the vehicle, run the command /fillpool,
- When you want to empty the pool, run the command /emptypool

# Future Developments

In the future, I would like to be able to link it up with some other products to allow for refilling of engines etc from the tanker.

If anyone wants to contribute to the project please feel free to shoot me a DM on discord @ JackTheDev
